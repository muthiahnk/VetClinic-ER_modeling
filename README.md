Implementation of a Database for a Clinic to keep track of the information about appointments, owners, pets and the services offered

## Company Background
  The Ark Veterinary Clinic is a local veterinary clinic company founded in 1996 in Chennai, INDIA. It started out as a small facility, and gradually grew upon good reviews from veterinarians in the area. The Ark Veterinary Clinic currently has around 20 employees. This consists of 15 regular staff and 5 veterinarians. The clinic contains state of the art medical, surgical and lab equipment. This clinic offers a variety of services serving to all clientele commonly found in households such as dogs, cats and birds. Here is a list of services currently offered:

●	Annual Examination
●	Orthopedics
●	Diagnostic and Lab Procedure
●	Emergency Care
●	Pet surgery services

## Business Process
Here is the procedure by which the veterinary clinic operates and provides service to patients:
●	The owner of the dog will call the veterinary to set up appointment for his/her pet. The owner will provide his/her name along the name of the patient (pet). Based on the provided information the clinic will either record or pull patient history and an appointment will be set up. 
●	If it is a new customer certain information will be requested such as the type of pet and services required.
●	When the patient visits the store, the information of the patient will be pulled up via the appointment previously scheduled. 
●	At the end of the visit the services performed will be recorded and charged to the owner through one of the billing options. 
●	Medication may also be prescribed to the patient, in which case it will be added to billing and patient information.
●	The vet clinic will also offer boarding services with specific rates based on the type of animals and the duration of stay.

## Current Issues and Solution:
  Currently the organization is using paperwork/ledger system to keep track of the information about the appointments, owner, pet and the services offered for each of the customers during their visit. This type of system to track the information would be useful when the number of customers is small, but as the customer base grows it will be very difficult to track. Also, it would not be quickly accessible and we can lose information about the customer or the services done. In other words, we cannot have a good control over the data. To solve this purpose, I have created a database which has the following advantages:
  ●	Keeping better tracking of past and present records
  ●	Ability to update client information
  ●	Quick accessibility is one of the main issues that is prevailing
  ●	We can avoid redundancy in the customer information
  ●	Increased security
